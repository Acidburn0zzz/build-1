# Building / Updating FreeNAS 10

To update an existing FreeNAS 10 instance that you are using for development
purposes:

* make update
* make ports
* make reinstall-package package=freenas host=root@1.2.3.4```

Where 1.2.3.4 is the IP address of your development platform.  SSH will be
used to push and install the new packages onto that host.

To build FreeNAS 10 from scratch (experts only):

## Requirements:

* Your build environment must be FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE or FreeBSD 10-STABLE
(building on FreeBSD 9 or 11 is not supported at this time).

* An amd64 capable processor.  8GB of memory, or an equal/greater amount
  of swap space, is also required.

* You will need the following ports/packages when compiling anything
  FreeNAS-related:
  * ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel
  * devel/git
  * sysutils/cdrtools
  * archivers/pxz
  * lang/python (2.7 or later, with THREADS support)
  * sysutils/grub2-pcbsd
  * sysutils/xorriso
  * www/npm
  * devel/gmake
  * py-sphinx
  * py-sphinx_rtd_theme
  * py-sphinxcontrib-httpdomain

  (and all the dependencies that these ports/pkgs install, of course)

## Building the System Quickstart Flow:

Note: All these commands must be run as `root`.

```
% make checkout
% make release
```

* Update the source tree, to pull in new source code changes

```
% make update
```

This will also fetch TrueOS and ports for the build from github.

## The End Result:

If your build completes successfully, you'll have release bits in the _BE
directory.
