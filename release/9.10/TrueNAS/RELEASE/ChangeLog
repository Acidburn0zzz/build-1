Enhancements:

o Remove auto LUN numbering from the block configuration.  This
  could cause issues when an auto numbered LUN was deleted by

o Warn when deleting LUNs that are in use.

o Update the serial port choices for serial console on the
  Z-series hardware to list the correct serial port(s)

o Warn about a potential service interruption  when moving
  the system dataset.

Critical Fixes:

o Fix a bug that could cause an HA failover to not occur when
  networking fails to the active node of an HA pair.

o Fix a kernel panic that could occur when adding vlan or lagg
  interfaces.

o Fix some replication issues when the source or target is a
  top level dataset.

Non-Critical Fixes:

o Fix the GUI display of datasets with more than three levels
  of nesting.

o Fix a bug preventing SNMP from exporting zilstat values.

o Fix a bug that prevented alerts from being generated when
  the support license is expired.

o Suppress the STANDBY node of an HA pair from sending "Assuming
  "Backup" emails when there's network glitches.

o Cut down on the verbosity of some overly chatty logging.
