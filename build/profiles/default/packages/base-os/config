[Services]

# This is a list of comma-seperated services provided by this package.
# "reboot" is kinda special.
# Note that I removed "DirectoryServices"
services = SMB, AFP, NFS, iSCSI, WebDAV, reboot

# This is a list of comma-seperated services that will always be
# be restarted when this package is update.  "all" means all services
# provided by this package.
# In this case, nothing is automatically restarted, because base-os requires
# a reboot unless otherwise stated.
# restart = all
