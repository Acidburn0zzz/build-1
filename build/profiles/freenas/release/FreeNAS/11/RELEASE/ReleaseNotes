We are pleased to announce the general availability of FreeNAS 11.1.  
This release delivers many performance improvements, new and updated
drivers, new features and enhancements, and bug fixes. FreeNAS 11.1 can
be used and distributed free of charge, and updates are freely available.

Operating System
FreeNAS 11.1 is based on the FreeBSD 11.1-STABLE operating system, which
includes numerous performance improvements, new and updated drivers, new
features, and bug fixes.

OpenZFS

OpenZFS has seen many improvements. Users will notice a significant
speedup when listing a large number of snapshots or deleting multiple
snapshots and large files.

The scrub and resilver algorithm implement substantial speed improvements
which will be most noticeable on fragmented pools.

Resilver Priority has been added to Storage. Resilvering, which rebuilds
the storage array, can now be run at a higher priority at configurable
times and days of the week.

disabled is resolved with the 00.30.00 or newer BMC firmware version.

The Identify Light button has been added to identify a system in a rack
by flashing its Unit ID light.

with cloud service providers. Supported services include Amazon S3, Azure
