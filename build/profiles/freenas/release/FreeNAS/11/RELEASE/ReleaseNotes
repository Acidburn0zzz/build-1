We are pleased to announce the general availability of FreeNAS 11.2-BETA1.
This initial version of the 11.2 series is considered to be
feature-complete and ready for testing. Users, especially those who use
Plugins, Jails, or VMs, are encouraged to update to this release in order
to take advantage of the many improvements and bug fixes to those
subsystems. Please report any bugs to
https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/. 

These major features are new in the 11.2 series:

The login screen defaults to the new, Angular-based UI. Users who wish to
continue to use the classic UI can select “Legacy UI” in the login screen. 

Beginning with this release, the screenshots that appear in the published
version of the Guide and in the Guide icon within the new UI are for the
new UI. However, users who click on the Guide icon while logged into the
classic UI will continue to see screenshots for the old UI. The
availability of both versions of the Guide is to assist users as they
become familiar with the new UI during the transition period before the
classic UI is deprecated in a future release. 

The rewrite from the old API to the new middlewared continues. Once the API
stabilizes and the rewrite is complete, api.freenas.org will be deprecated
and replaced by the new API documentation. In the mean time, to see the API
documentation for the new middleware, log into the new UI, click on the URL
for the FreeNAS system in your browser’s location bar, and add :api/docs to
the end of that URL. 

The boot loader has changed from GRUB to the native FreeBSD boot loader.
This should resolve several issues that some users experienced with GRUB.
GRUB was introduced as a temporary solution until the FreeBSD boot
loader had full support for boot environments, which it now has. 

The Plugins and Jails backend has switched from warden to iocage and
warden will no longer receive bug fixes. The new UI will automatically
use iocage to create and manage Plugins and Jails. Users are encouraged
to recreate any existing Plugins and Jails using the new UI to ensure
that they are running the latest supported application versions. 

Virtual Machines are more crash-resistant. When a guest is started, the
amount of available memory is checked and an initialization error will
occur if there is insufficient system resources. When a guest is stopped,
its resources are returned to the system. In addition, the UEFI boot menu
fix allows Linux kernels 4.15 and higher to boot properly. 

Cloud Sync Tasks provides configuration options to encrypt data before it
is transmitted and to keep it in the encrypted format while stored on the
cloud. The filenames can also be encrypted. 

Preliminary support has been added for Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs). 

OpenZFS is up-to-date with Illumos and slightly ahead due to support for
sorted scrubs which were ported from ZFS on Linux. Notable improvements
include channel programs, data disk removal, more resilient volume import,
the ability to import a pool with missing vdevs, pool checkpoints,
improved compressed ARC performance, and ZIL batching. Note that many of
these improvements need further testing so have not yet been integrated
into the UI.
