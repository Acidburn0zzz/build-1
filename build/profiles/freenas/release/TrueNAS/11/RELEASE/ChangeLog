Additionally, these bug fixes and features are specific to TrueNAS:

There have been several bug fixes for HA. The active node will now wait
for the passive node to stabilize before turning the HA icon green. The
system will indicate that you cannot destroy or detach a volume when
failover is enabled and warn before deleting a pool that is required for
HA to function. An alert will be generated when the passive node is
unreachable via the failover interface and the system will not allow a
failed passive node to take the active node's IP address.

Several alerts have been added to provide advance notification with regards
to licensing. These include email notifications at 14, 30, 90, and 180
days before support contract expiration and at support contract
expiration. Additionally, an alert will be generated when the number of
connected JBODs exceeds the license.

The  System Serial and System Product fields have been added to System ->
Information. For HA configurations, the System Serial will also include
the serial number of the other HA node.

The View Enclosure screen has moved from Storage -> Volumes to System.

The “Factory Restore” button has been renamed to “Reset Configuration
Defaults”.
